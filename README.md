# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Mission to Mars:

The purpose of Mission to Mars project was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres. We then stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used a web application (Flask) to display the data. Lastly, we altered and designed the web app to accommodate these images and their appropriate titles.

## Results: 

### Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles 



# Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles 



# Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
