# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Mission to Mars:

The purpose of Mission to Mars project was to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres. We then stored the scraped data on a Mongo database and used a web application (Flask) to display the data. Lastly, we altered and designed the web app to accommodate these images and their appropriate titles.
